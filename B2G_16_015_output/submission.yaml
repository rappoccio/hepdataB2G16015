comment: A search for the production of heavy resonances decayinginto top quark-antiquark
  pairs is presented. The analysis is performed in thelepton+jets and fully hadronic
  channels usingdata collected in proton-proton collisions at$\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ using
  the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.6\fbinv.
  The selection isoptimized for massive resonances, where the top quarks have largeLorentz
  boosts. No evidence for resonant \ttbarproduction is found in the data, and upper
  limits on the production cross sectionof heavy resonances are set. The exclusion
  limits forresonances with masses above 2\TeV are significantly improvedcompared
  to those of previous analyses at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$.

  passingthe signal selection of the lepton+jets analysis ($\chi^{2}<30$) after the
  maximum likelihood fit.Distributions are shown for the muon (left) and electron
  (right) channel.For each lepton flavor, events are split into three exclusive categories(from
  uppermost to lowest):$\It$,$\OtIb$, and$\OtOb$.The signal templates are normalized
  to a cross section of 1\unit{pb}.The uncertainties associated with the background
  expectation includethe statistical and all post-fit systematic uncertainties.The
  lower panel in each figure shows the ratio of data to predicted SM background, withthe
  statistical (light gray) andtotal (dark gray) uncertainties shown separately.
